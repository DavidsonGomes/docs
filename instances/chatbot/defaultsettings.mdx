You can set a default setting for your bot integrations, and for every new bot onboarded it will follow that default unless you set it up at the time of creation.


### Settings  

- **Expire in Minutes:** Set session timeout (`0` for no expiration).  
- **Keyword to Finish:** End conversations using a keyword (default: `#FINISH`).  
- **Default Delay Message:** Delay between bot messages (`1000ms` by default).  
- **Unknown Message:** Fallback response for unrecognized input.  
- **Debounce Time:** Prevent duplicate messages (`0ms` by default).  
- **Split Messages:** Split long messages for better readability.  
- **Ignore JIDs:** Exclude specific user IDs (e.g., `1234567890@s.whatsapp.net`).  

Optimize these settings to enhance user experience and maintain smoother interactions.
