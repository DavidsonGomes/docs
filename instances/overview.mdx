An **instance** in Evolution represents a **connection point** between a customer's messaging channel and your project. Each instance:
- Is assigned to a specific customer within a project
- Uses one of the customer's enabled channels (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Can integrate with chatbots, events, and APIs
- Is accessed using a unique instance token and ID

For WhatsApp Web channels, connecting is as simple as scanning a QR code with the customer's WhatsApp.
