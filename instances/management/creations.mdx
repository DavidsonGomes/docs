To create an instance in Evolution, follow these steps:

## Select a Customer
Choose a customer from the list of those already created in the project. Ensure the selected customer has enabled channels.

## Choose a Channel
Pick one of the channels available for the selected customer (e.g., WhatsApp Web, API, Telegram).  
For non-WhatsApp Web channels, additional information like the user's phone number may be required.

## Connect the Instance
- **WhatsApp Web**: Scan the QR code generated within the instance to link it to the customer's WhatsApp.
- **Other Channels**: Provide the required configuration details based on the selected channel.

## Configure Integrations
Inside the instance, you can:
- Integrate **chatbots** for automated messaging.
- Set up **custom events** for specific actions or triggers.
- Use the **API** by including the instance token (`apikey`) in the request headers and the instance ID in the route path.
