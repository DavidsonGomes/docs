Configure webhooks to receive event notifications from your instance. Here's how to set it up:

## Basic Configuration
1. Enable the webhook using the toggle in the top-left corner
2. Enter the URL where you want to receive webhook events
3. Configure additional options:
   - **Webhook by Events**: Enable to use different URLs for different events
   - **Base64 Webhook**: Enable to receive files as base64-encoded strings

## Event Selection
Select which events you want to monitor from the available list. Each selected event will trigger a notification to your webhook URL.

## Managing Your Webhook
- You can disable the webhook at any time using the "Enabled" toggle
- Test your webhook configuration to ensure proper event delivery
