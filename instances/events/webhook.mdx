Within the webhook **settings** associated with your **instance**, there is a series of events you can enable. First, **activate your webhook** and then configure the **URL** you want the webhook to trigger when a specific event occurs. If you want to **create a separate route for each event**, enable the "Webhook by Events" option. If it is necessary to **send files**, enable the **"Base64 Webhook"** option. You can then select which events the webhook will track and integrate with your configured URL. If you wish to **stop the webhook at any time**, simply deactivate it using the **"Enabled" button** in the top-left corner of the screen.
