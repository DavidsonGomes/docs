To enable and configure the **websocket**, simply click on the enable button, select the events you want to track and receive updates. Use the url **wss://api.yourdomain.com/{instanceName}** within your system and that's it, you will now receive messages **triggered** by the **evolution websocket**. Use the **domain or IP** if you are running evolution on a separate server.
