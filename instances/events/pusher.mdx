To configure Pusher in the system, you need to fill in the following fields:

- **APP ID**: The unique identifier for your Pusher application. You can find this in your Pusher dashboard under the application settings.

- **Key**: The public key for your Pusher application. This is used for authenticating connections.

- **Secret**: The private key for your Pusher application. This is used for server-side authentication and must be kept secure.

- **Cluster**: The cluster where your Pusher application is hosted (e.g., `us2`, `eu`, `ap2`). You can find the cluster information in your Pusher dashboard.

Ensure all these fields are filled in correctly to enable successful integration with Pusher.
