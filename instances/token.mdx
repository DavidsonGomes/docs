Here you can find your instance's API information:
- Base URL for API requests
- Instance token for authentication (can only be customized during instance creation)
- Instance ID used in API routes

<Warning>These values cannot be modified after creation and are unique to your instance. Keep your token secure and never share it publicly.</Warning>
