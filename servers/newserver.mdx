To use a Personal project type, you'll need to run EvolutionAPI on your own infrastructure. This guide explains how to register your self-hosted server with EvolutionAPI Cloud.

## Prerequisites

Before registering your server, make sure you have:
- A running EvolutionAPI instance (version 2.2.1 or higher)
- Access to your server's admin panel or configuration
- Your server's API token

## Server Registration

To register your server, you'll need to provide:

- **Server URL**  
  The complete URL where your EvolutionAPI instance is running (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com`)

- **API Token**  
  Your server's authentication token. This can be found in your EvolutionAPI instance's admin panel or configuration file.

- **Version**  
  The version of EvolutionAPI you're running. 
  <Warning>Only versions 2.2.1 and above are supported for integration with EvolutionAPI Cloud.</Warning>

## Verification

After entering your server details:
1. The system will verify the connection to your server
2. If successful, your server will be registered and available for use in Personal projects
3. You can then create Personal projects that use your self-hosted instances
