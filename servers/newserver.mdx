- Access to your server's admin panel or configuration

## Setup Instructions

1. **Deploy the API Server:**  
   Install and configure EvolutionAPI on your server or VM according to the [official deployment documentation](#).

2. **Retrieve the Token:**  
   Obtain the API token from your EvolutionAPI admin panel or the configuration file.

3. **Configure the Version:**  
   Select the desired API version. For stability and support, versions `2.2.1+` are recommended.

4. **Testing the Setup:**  
   Verify the API connection by sending a test request using the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "<your-server-url>/health" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
  
## Verification

After entering your server details:
1. The system will verify the connection to your server
2. If successful, your server will be registered and available for use in Personal projects
3. You can then create Personal projects that use your self-hosted instances
