## **Creating**
**Customers** are users that you can create within your account and assign to a **specific project instance**. You can enable automatic account creation for them upon registration, configure the channels they can use **(e.g., WhatsApp Web, WhatsApp Evolution, and Evolution)**, and manage their access. Customers are only available within the project they were created in. If a user account is created for a customer, logging in will grant them access to the project they belong to.

## **Modules**

Here, during customer creation, you **can enable modules** that allow the user to integrate with **chatbots**, interact with the **CRM**, and configure events like webhooks,websocket and Pusher. Even after creation, you **can update these customer settings**, enabling or disabling them as needed.
