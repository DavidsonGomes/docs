Before proceeding with integrations, automations, and instances, this panel allows you to manage your **users**, view account **limits**, generate authentication tokens, and **create/manage projects on the projects screen**. Projects are structures where you can create customers, instances, and chatbot integrations. Customers, instances, and integrations created within a project exist solely in that project. If a project is deleted, it triggers a cascading effect. Projects adhere to the same limits as your account.
