The EvolutionAPI platform has 4 user types, organized into two categories: **B2B** and **B2C**.

## **B2B Category**

- **Tenant**  
  The primary user responsible for complete platform administration.

- **Team Member**  
  A member of the Tenant's team with full access to resources, except for user management.

## **B2C Category**

- **Customer**  
  A client of the Tenant, linked to a project. The Customer has access to one or more instances, including all content and users within those instances.

## **Creating a Team Member**

On the home page, you can create a team member user who will have their own account.
