## **Creating**
**Customers** are entities you can create within your account and assign to a **specific project instance**. For each customer, you can optionally create a user account that allows them to log in and manage their own resources. You can configure which channels they can use **(e.g., WhatsApp Web, WhatsApp Evolution, and Evolution)**, and manage their access permissions. Customers are only available within the project they were created in. If you create a user account for a customer, they will only have access to resources within their assigned project.

## **Modules**

During customer creation, you **can enable modules** that provide access to different features:
- Integration with **chatbots**
- **CRM** interaction
- Event configurations (webhooks, websocket, and Pusher)

You **can modify these module settings** at any time after creation, enabling or disabling them as needed.
