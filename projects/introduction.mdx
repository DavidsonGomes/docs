The projects page displays all your created projects and allows you to manage them. Each project shows the number of customers and instances associated with it. You can search for specific projects using the search bar at the top.

## Project Types

When creating a new project, you can choose between two types:

- **Cloud**  
  A fully managed project hosted on our infrastructure. Ideal for users who want a ready-to-use solution without managing servers.

- **Personal**  
  Allows you to manage your own self-hosted EvolutionAPI instances through our SaaS interface. This requires registering your server first - see our <a href="/servers/newserver">servers documentation</a> for setup instructions.

## Creating a Project

To create a new project:

1. Click the **Project +** button in the top-right corner
2. Enter a name for your project
3. Select the project type (Cloud or Personal)
4. Click **Save** to create your project

<Note>Projects help you organize your resources. All customers, instances, and integrations created within a project are isolated to that project and count towards your account limits.</Note>
